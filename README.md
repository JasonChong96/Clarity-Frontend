[Access the application through this link.](https://chatwithora.com "Ora")


## Quick Start
```
npm install
npm start
```

## Back-end Server

The back-end can be found in another repository located [here](https://github.com/snguyenthanh/ora-backend)

## Risks of Usage

Although Ora has undergone some live testing and user validation and is sufficiently usable, there are some caveats to using it.

### Possible Bugs

There may be undiscovered bugs as several major changes were made after the live testing. Most testing was also done on Google Chrome, which means that different browsers such as Safari might experience some quirks. Extensive testing needs to be done to figure out if there are any such bugs.

### Code Quality

Some files are really large (e.g StaffMain.js) and some unused actions have not been removed as the focus of our team was to push out the features as fast as possible.
